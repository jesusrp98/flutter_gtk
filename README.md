# Flutter GTK üßä

Implementation of GTK & Adwaita widgets in Flutter.

This project aims to provide a set of tools and widgets derived from the GTK library for GNU+Linux systems.

It allows the development of apps for Linux desktops, and provides a similiar user experience compared to 'native' GTK-based apps.

## Example

You can find an example app within this project. It emulates the Clock app for GNOME.

## Widgets

This is the list of all currently available widgets found in this package.

### AdwaitaHeaderBar

This widget implements the window header bar introduced in GTK 3.

You can place elements at the left, right or center of the panel.

There's also the posibility to rener the window control buttons, such as minimize, maximize & close.

```
AdwaitaHeaderBar(
  onMinimize: () => appWindow.minimize(),
  onMaximize: () => appWindow.maximizeOrRestore(),
  onClose: () => appWindow.close(),
  leading: AdwaitaHeaderButton(
    icon: Icons.add,
    onTap: () => null,
  ),
  center: AdwaitaViewSwitcher(
    tabs: [
      ViewSwitcherData(
        icon: Icons.language,
        title: 'World',
      ),
      // ...
    ],
  ),
  trailling: AdwaitaHeaderButton(
    icon: Icons.menu,
    onTap: () => null,
  )
)
```

### AdwaitaViewSwitcher

This widget provides view switching functionality.

It looks and feel pretty similar to the `HdyViewSwitcherBar` component provided by `libhandy`.

```
AdwaitaViewSwitcher(
  tabs: [
    ViewSwitcherData(
      icon: Icons.language,
      title: 'World',
    ),
    // ...
  ]
)
```

### AdwaitaHeaderButton

A simple icon button, that can also display text, that usually is display within a `AdwaitaHeaderBar` widget.

```
AdwaitaHeaderButton(
  icon: Icons.menu,
  onTap: () => null,
)
```
